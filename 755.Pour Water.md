We are given an elevation map, heights[i] representing the height of the terrain at that index. The width at each index is 1. After V units of water fall at index K, how much water is at each index?

Water first drops at index K and rests on top of the highest terrain or water at that index. Then, it flows according to the following rules:

If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left.
Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then move right.
Otherwise, rise at it's current position.
Here, "eventually fall" means that the droplet will eventually be at a lower level if it moves in that direction. Also, "level" means the height of the terrain plus any water in that column.
We can assume there's infinitely high terrain on the two sides out of bounds of the array. Also, there could not be partial water being spread out evenly on more than 1 grid block - each unit of water has to be in exactly one block.

First, I made a mistake in my brute force version:
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pourWater(vector<int>& heights, int V, int K) {
        // first we consider brute force method 
        while(V-- )
        {
            drop(heights,K);
        }
        return heights;
    }
private:
    void drop(vector<int> & heights, int K)
    {   
        int n=heights.size();
        int index=K-1;
        if(K==0) goto rightshift;
        
        
        for(;index>=0;index--) //here, V must be >=1 
        {
          if( heights[index]<=heights[index+1]) continue;
          else 
          {break;}// make unified effort to decrease index 
        }// for ends
        
        if(++ index < K) {heights[index]++; return;} 
        //index should be K 
        /* cout<<"Index:"<<index<<'\n'
            <<"K:"<<K<<endl; */
rightshift:
        if(K==n-1) goto stay; //special case for V==n-1
        for(index =K; index<n-1;index++) // index starting from V
        {
            if( heights[index+1]<=heights[index]) continue;
            else
            {
                break; 
            }
        }
       if(index==K) goto stay;
       else
       {
           heights[index]++;
           return;
       }
        
stay:
        heights[K]++;
        return;
    }
};
```

It basically has three branches: go left, go right and stay right where it is. But I wrongly assmumed that it will only choose one of the three braches. In fact, if the input is [2,2,3,1],1,2 it will produce the wrong [3,2,3,1] instead of [2,2,3,2] . To fix this, we have to modify some logic in the left-shifting section
Still, two *gotos* here are bad practice.
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pourWater(vector<int>& heights, int V, int K) {
        // first we consider brute force method 
        while(V-- )
        {
            drop(heights,K);
        }
        return heights;
    }
private:
    void drop(vector<int> & heights, int K)
    {   
        int n=heights.size();
        int index=K-1;
        int comparison= K ; //introduce comparison because to avoid the bug in left branch
        if(K==0) goto rightshift;
        
        
        for(;index>=0;index--) //here, V must be >=1 
        {
          if( heights[index]<=heights[index+1]) continue;
          else 
          {break;}
        }// for ends
        
        if( (++ index < K) && heights[index]!=heights[K]) {heights[index]++; return;} 
        //index should be K 
        comparison=index;
       
rightshift:
        if(K==n-1) goto stay; //special case for V==n-1
        for(index =K; index<n-1;index++) // index starting from V
        {
            if( heights[index+1]<=heights[index]) continue;
            else
            {
                break; 
            }
        }
       if(index==K) goto stay;
       else if(heights[comparison]>heights[index])
       {
           heights[index]++;
           return;
       }
       
       else if(heights[comparison]<heights[index])
       {
           heights[comparison]++;
           return;
       }
        
stay:
        heights[K]++;
        return;
    }
};
···
But it still fails the test case, this is because ....

Let's forget about this first,,
check the best answer I found onlinee:
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pourWater(vector<int>& heights, int V, int K) {
        while (V--) drop(heights, K);
        return heights;    
    }
private:
    void drop(vector<int>& heights, int K) {
        int best = K;
        for (int d = -1; d <= 1; d += 2) {
            int i = K + d;
            while (i >= 0 && i < heights.size() 
                   && heights[i] <= heights[i - d]) {
                if (heights[i] < heights[best]) best = i;
                i += d;
            }
            if (best != K) break;
        }
        ++heights[best];
    }
};
```
