###1. Two Sum

题目:
<https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/>


难度:

Easy


思路

可以用O(n^2) loop

但是也可以牺牲空间换取时间，异常聪明的AC解法

```
          2        7        11    15
         不存在   存在之中
lookup   {2:0}    [0，1]
```

一点字典有了这个 `target - 当前数字`,找到它的index和当前index一起返回。

####Python O(n^2)

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in nums:
           if target-i in nums[nums.index(i)+1:]:
                   return [nums.index(i),nums[nums.index(i)+1:].index(target-i)+nums.index(i)+1]
```

Python Two-pass Hash Table

To improve our run time complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to look up its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

We reduce the look up time from O(n)O(n) to O(1)O(1) by trading space for speed. A hash table is built exactly for this purpose, it supports fast look up in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a look up could degenerate to O(n)O(n) time. But look up in hash table should be amortized O(1)O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value and its index to the table. Then, in the second iteration we check if each element's complement (target - nums[i]target−nums[i]) exists in the table. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i]nums[i] itself!
```
#the code below will not work if there are duplicate elements in the array 
class Solution():
    def twoSum(self,nums,target):
        lookup=dict()
        for i,num in enumerate(nums):
            lookup[num]=i
        for j in nums:
            if target-j in lookup and lookup[target-j]!=lookup[j]:
                
                return [lookup[j],lookup[target-j]]
        
```

```
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        lookup = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in lookup:
                return [lookup[target - num],i]
            lookup[num] = i
        return []
```
